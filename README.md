# Abstract


Our study examines biases in resume screening using machine learning approaches applied to Bertrand and Mullainathan's 2004 dataset of nearly 5,000 resumes sent to Boston and Chicago job postings. Through logistic regression and decision tree modeling, we identified factors that significantly influenced callback decisions. Our findings reveal that first names associated with racial identity substantially impact callback rates, with Black-sounding names decreasing callback likelihood by 36.8%. Both models showed explainable biases for factors like special skills (increasing callback odds by 117.9%) and years of experience, while also demonstrating persistent bias based on perceived racial identity from first names. The decision tree confirmed name-based discrimination as the second most influential factor after experience. These results emphasize the need for anonymous application processes and rigorous testing of algorithmic hiring tools to prevent the perpetuation of historical biases in recruitment processes.
